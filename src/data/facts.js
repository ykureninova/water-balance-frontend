    title: "Skin & Digestion",
    short: "Drinking enough water keeps your skin elastic and glowing...",
    content: `Water is essential for maintaining skin elasticity and a healthy glow. When you're properly hydrated, your skin cells are plump and resilient, reducing the appearance of fine lines and dryness.\n\nMoreover, water plays a crucial role in digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients so your body can absorb them efficiently and supports smooth bowel movements by softening stool and preventing constipation.\n\nStudies show that people who drink adequate water daily have clearer skin and better digestive health than those who are chronically dehydrated.`,

    short: "Even mild dehydration reduces focus and cognitive performance",
    content: `Your brain is about 75% water. Even a 1–2% drop in hydration can impair attention, memory, and mood.\n\nResearch from the University of Connecticut showed that mild dehydration causes difficulty in concentration, increased perception of task difficulty, and headaches. Students who carried a water bottle throughout the day performed significantly better on exams than those who didn't.\n\nDrinking water regularly helps maintain optimal brain function — it's like giving your mind a clear signal instead of static.`,

    title: "Energy & Mood",
    short: "Proper hydration fights fatigue and stabilizes mood",
    content: `Feeling tired or irritable? You might just be thirsty.\n\nDehydration reduces blood volume, making your heart work harder to pump oxygen and nutrients. This leads to fatigue, tension, and anxiety. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that women who were just 1.5% dehydrated reported worse mood, lower concentration, and more headaches.\n\nOn the flip side — drinking water can instantly boost alertness and improve emotional balance.`,

    short: "Drinking water before meals helps control appetite",
    content: `Water is the ultimate zero-calorie appetite suppressant.\n\nA study from Virginia Tech showed that people who drank two glasses of water before meals lost 44% more weight over 12 weeks than those who didn't. Water fills your stomach, sending signals of fullness to your brain before you even start eating.\n\nAdditionally, thirst is often mistaken for hunger. Next time you crave a snack — try water first.`,

    title: "Muscle Recovery",
    short: "Water prevents cramps and speeds up recovery after exercise",
    content: `Muscles are 80% water. During exercise, you lose fluids through sweat — and with them, essential electrolytes.\n\nDehydration reduces muscle strength, endurance, and increases the risk of cramps and injury. Proper hydration helps deliver oxygen and nutrients to working muscles and removes lactic acid faster.\n\nProfessional athletes know: the fastest way to recover after a workout is to rehydrate immediately.`,

    title: "Detoxification",
    short: "Kidneys need water to filter toxins effectively",
    content: `Your kidneys filter about 150 liters of blood every day — and they need water to do it properly.\n\nWhen you're well-hydrated, kidneys efficiently remove waste, excess sodium, and toxins through urine. Chronic low water intake forces them to work harder and can lead to kidney stones and urinary tract infections.\n\nThink of water as the ultimate natural detox — no expensive juice cleanse required.`,
